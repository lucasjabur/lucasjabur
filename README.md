**`Computer Science Undergraduate (Federal University of Uberlandia, Brazil üáßüá∑)`**

I'm a student with one goal: to learn as much as I can while having fun along the way. I'm on this journey to become a good developer, and above all, a good Computer Scientist, with well-established foundations and consolidated knowledge in the field. I don't want to be just another one, I don't want to just play at being a programmer. It's a passion and it's my future.
In this GitHub profile I have the mission of posting different codes, exercises, projects and learnings that I build over time, improving with each line of code built.

You can follow me on LinkedIn to know me better!

 <summary><h3>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª More about me</h3></summary>
    My journey began in 2020, when I was a student studying Mechatronics Engineering at the Federal University of Uberlandia (UFU) and it was there that I had my first contact with programming, more specifically learning the basics of the C language. I fell in love with the grandeur of the area, a world apart from reality where, apparently, anything is possible. I continued to study programming little by little, I got to know the Python programming language and in 2022 I got my first professional experience.
    I was a Scientific Initiation student at the Structural Mechanics Laboratory (LMEst, UFU).
    There I was in charge of building systems and metamodels for high computational cost simulations in Python using the SMT library: Surrogate Modeling Toolbox. These metamodels were used in software created to simulate and predict failures in large-scale structures at the Foz de Chapec√≥ Hydroelectric Power Plant. The project includes partnerships with companies such as CPFL Energia and Usina Foz de Chapec√≥.
    I learned a lot within the project, not only did I develop more skills with the Python language, but I also learned how to use the Git tool and developed important softskills that every good developer should have. 
    It was after this experience that I decided to transfer to Computer Science. I felt - and feel even more so today - a thirst to learn more about the area. My journey began in the middle of 2023 and I'm still on it.
    So far I've developed skills in C, Java, as well as important theoretical knowledge and programming fundamentals such as logic, algorithms and data structures.
    I'm currently part of the following project:
    "Building a proof of concept for an application to locate points of interest within the UFU Hospital das Cl√≠nicas".
    Our aim is to build an indoor navigation web-app for use within the facilities of the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas of the Federal University of Uberlandia.
    Much more to come over time!
    Thank you!
